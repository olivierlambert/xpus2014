# Xen Orchestra - Xen Project User Summit

XO presentation for the Xen Project User Summit 2014 - NYC

Note: this is a **user** summit, not a dev one. The public is eager to know more about how to use Xen. So we need to put real example, use case etc.

Repeat architecture and possibilities

Roadmap:
- ACL + user management + LDAP Backend
- Graphs (RRD) showing CPU, RAM, IO load etc.
- Console working behind a NAT (console proxy in xo-server)
- Managing hotfixes directly in XO (with auto search for new updates)
- Backup management directly in XOA ("xo-backup")
- Import/Export VM with GUI
- PCI (and GPU) management in GUI (passthrough)
- D3js data viz
- Infrastructure analysis and diag (through whole RRDs recorded)
- Load management (auto migrate if necessary, adapt VM sizing when needed)

### ACL (+ sketches)

### Import and export
